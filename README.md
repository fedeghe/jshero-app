Experimental js console for Ô£ø

This app is under development, for fun, still there are a lot of limitations, among which, but not limited to the following:
- there's no code assistance neither transpilation
- to see some output use `console.log`.

There are other problems but to some extent it is usable and will get better soon üëç
