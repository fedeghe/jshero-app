Experimental js console for Ô£ø

This app is under development, for fun, still there are a lot of limitations, among which, but not limited to the following:
- there's no code assistance, thus you should write decent javascript:  `;` are NOT optional.
- cant use inline comments, only `/* */` are not breaking.
- console.log is not captured; to see some out put  just name it in the ending line, whatever it is.
- timeouts are ignored, thus do not expect a delayed output, the whole script evaluation mechanism will be changed soon.

There are other problems but to some extent it is usable and will get better soon üëç
