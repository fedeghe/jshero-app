From the very first available public releases I've always been amazed by _runjs_!!! 

Up to version 1.15.1 (included) there was one really useful feature: the ability to _manage npm packages from within the app_, and those where only affecting the app context, really useful feature.
I use(d) it to quickly try something and check the result as a small javascript playground to validate small things.

The updates are forced (regardless the auto-update preferences, indeed being a non certified app you have to accept on the usual modal that appears when you stert those unvefified apps for the very first time),
and whenever a new version is available there is no apparent way to avoid the update. Actually I discovered how and it's quite straight-forward, thus I still can run the last free useful version of runjs, but somehow I started to feel itchy.

The point is that the author switched into a yearly based subscription for some features among which the node_modules manager (the only one truly relevant for me). **Really a miserable move**.

Aware that _runjs_ was developed using [electron js](https://www.electronjs.org/), I started investing some time developing something similar, aiming to the features I was used to have for free in _runjs_, but quickly after getting there I realized the right direction was poiting elsewhere. For the moment I keep the sourcecode in a private repo but the build _.dmg_ file is instead in a public repo; also for the moment I only build the MacOS version.

In case you could provide some feedback it would be outgareously great for me.
