From the very first available public releases I've always been amazed by Runjs (runjs.app)!!! 

Up to version 1.15.1 (included) there was one really useful feature: the ability to manage npm packages from within the app, and those where only affecting the app context, really useful feature.
I use(d) it to quickly try something and check the result as a small javascript playground to validate small things.

The updates are forced (regardless the auto-update preferences, indeed being a non certified app you have to accept on the usual modal that appears when you stert those unvefified apps for the very first time),
and whenever a new version is available there is no apparent way to avoid the update (actually there is, in fact I still have it, yes the v. 1.15.1, and do not use it anymore).

The point is that the author switched into a yearly based subscription for some features among which the node_modules manager (the only one truly relevant for me). Nice move, I mean it really looks like a bird trap.
I fully understand that at some point one needs to monetize, but doing it on something you already gave for free it's a bad bad bad move.

Aware that runjs was developed using electron js (electronjs.org), I started investing some time developing something similar, aiming to the feature I was used to have for free in runjs. For the moment I keep the sourcecode in a private repo but the build _.dmg_ file is 
instead in a public repo.

In case you could provide some feedback it would be great for me.
